### Vyui (Pronounced View-e)
This is an educational and experimental creation. Vyui is intended to be a fullstack development framework for all things web. 

### But why? 
I'm a big fan of reverse engineering current systems and softwares so that I can build a personal understanding of how every piece ties together; I am the

### Inspirations:
This application will be taking inspiration from a variety of existing frameworks, this framework of creation is strictly for educational purposes, the 
following frameworks this is currently taking inspiration from are:

- Laravel
